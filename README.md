# IRIS-DATASET-VISUALIZATION-
### Project Description: Iris Dataset Visualization Using matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, and EDA
#### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset by visualizing various aspects of the data using matplotlib.pyplot (plt), numpy, seaborn, and pandas. This will help in understanding the datasetâ€™s structure, the relationships between features, and the distribution of data across different iris species.
